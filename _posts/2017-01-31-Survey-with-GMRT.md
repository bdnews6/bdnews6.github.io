This survey is the first in a series of surveys of star forming regions, taken at 325 and 610 MHz with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ([GMRT](http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/)). Full details of the observations, data reduction, images and source catalogue can be found in <i>Ainsworth R. E., Coughlan C. P., Green D. A., Scaife A. M. M., Ray T. P., 2016, MNRAS, 462, 2904</i> ([ads](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.462.2904A), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07245)).

## Summary

I define ‘philosophy’ as:
the personal search for truth, in any field, by rational means.

What Is Truth?
The study of the nature of truth is one of the “Big Questions” of philosophy, along with
things like: What is the meaning of life? What is good? What is beauty? and so on.


### The Correspondence Theory of Truth

The correspondence theory states that a belief is true if and only if that belief corresponds to the facts. . . . It captures the idea that truth depends on objective reality—
not on us. The problem the correspondence theory has concerns more technical
issues such as what a fact is and what the correspondence relation amounts to

#### The Coherence Theory of Truth
The coherence theory states that a proposition is true if and only if that proposition
coheres with the other propositions that one believes. . . . The problem with the
coherence theory is that a belief could be consistent with my other beliefs and yet
the whole lot could be false.

#### Correspondence vs. Coherence
Which theory is correct? Well, for one thing, there are more than two theories: There
are several versions of each kind of theory, and there are other theories of truth that
don’t fall under either category.
