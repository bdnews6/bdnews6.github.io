I sat upon a chair . . .

(but was it there?
 and what is ‘I’?
 and is ‘I’ me?
 . . . and had some thoughts on PHILOSOPHY
(where ‘had’ means ‘do’?

and ‘thoughts’: insights, or recall?

and the ‘Big P’ too:

defined by others, or by me?

or some view
overall?

And I wondered:

Is it always best when plainly told? . . .

(but best for what? for whom?

and ‘it’ means all, or some?

‘plainly’ means clear, or dry?

‘told’ means typed? orated?

how confidently stated?

and who should have this say?

. . . Or have fictional forms a part to play?

(but ‘fiction’: poetry? theatre?

music? art? prose?

comedy? tragedy? adventure?

long? short? episodic?

concise? verbose?

literal, or metaphoric?

epistolic? dialectic? parabolic . . . ?

WAIT!

This has become more abstruse than Zen.

I think I’d better start again:

I sat upon a chair . . .
