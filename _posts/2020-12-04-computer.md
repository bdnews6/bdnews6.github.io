## Is Computer Science Philosophy? 
I sat upon a chair . . .
(but was it there?
and what is ‘I’?
and is ‘I’ me?)
. . . and had some thoughts on
PHILOSOPHY
(where ‘had’ means ‘do’?
and ‘thoughts’: insights, or recall?
and the ‘Big P’ too:
defined by others, or by me?
or some view
overall?)
And I wondered:
Is it always best when plainly told? . . .
(but best for what? for whom?
and ‘it’ means all, or some?
‘plainly’ means clear, or dry?
‘told’ means typed? orated?
how confidently stated?
and who should have this say?)
. . . Or have fictional forms a part to play?
(but ‘fiction’: poetry? theatre?
music? art? prose?
comedy? tragedy? adventure?
long? short? episodic?
concise? verbose?
literal, or metaphoric?
epistolic? dialectic? parabolic . . . ?)
WAIT!
This has become more abstruse than Zen.
I think I’d better start again:
I sat upon a chair . . .
